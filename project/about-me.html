            <p class="bs-content">I decided to study computer science and engineering because I thought to myself, 
                what if I want to make a game some day. Since I can recall, 
                games have always been with me. I am grateful to them thus I wanted to some day create one. 
                Alas, I left that idea behind me. I dedicated my student life to gain skills in many other areas in computer 
                science to some day land a good job and gain a stable life-style right after graduation. 
                Then recently, I meditated on what I really want to do for my future, and I decided that I want to help 
                people using my skills. Thus I searched for jobs where I could meet these two requirements. I landed a job 
                at Accenture. Once I graduate, I will start there, and I hope that whatever I do can help people in some way.

                The person that inspires me the most and makes 
                me try my best in anything I do is my girlfriend Malena.
                She has always been there for me since first year in 
                university. She was my best friend before we became a 
                couple so we already knew each other very well.
                Weâ€™ve practically been together for 6 years and been a 
                couple for 3 now. I have basically decided to settle 
                down with her in the near future and for that I keep 
                trying my best at anything I do.

            <p class="future-content">
            In the near future I will move to Philadelphia and 
            start working at Accenture. This will be my first official 
            job. I am very nervous about it, but I am prepared for anything.
            I want to help a lot of people with the projects that I work in. 
            Another goal I have in mind is saving a bit of money and getting 
            married to Malena. I want to have a family with her also, thus I want to marry her.
