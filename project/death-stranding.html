                    <p>It was made with the intention of showing the viewer.</p> 
                    <p>what the world of the game consists of.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="written-story">
                    <p>From the time set in the game world, 49 years prior. The impending DOOM of the world was set in motion. 
                        The world was covered in what is known as the time-fall and with monsters known as <span>Beach Things (BT’s).</span> 
                        The world of the game is set in a post apocalyptic modern U.S.A. which has been destroyed and decayed due to 
                        these phenomenon occurring by the daily. 
                        <span>Timefall</span>, as we call the rain in this world, is more like an acid rain but instead of burning 
                        through stuff, it will make anything it touches to age quickly. Rendering it useless in a matter of seconds. 
                        This is why in this world, there are special materials which can last longer against the timefall and are used 
                        everywhere including buildings. Due to the timefalls, people tend to live peacefully inside the underground 
                        bunker-cities all over the USA (or whats left of it), now called the <span>UCA (United Cities of America).</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>Another thing to know about this world is what a “void-out” is. The reason the world is destroyed by these monsters called BT’s, is because: </p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>They’re invisible except for those that have a <span>BB (bridge baby)</span>. A BB is an unborn baby that has a connection to the afterlife, making it a bridge.</li>
                        <li>Whenever someone dies, their bodies must be disposed of, in a modern-day crematory building, with special equipment, or they will necrotize and become BTs.</li>
                        <li>If a BT consumes a <span>living</span> human body, a <span>void-out</span> will occur, killing everything withing a 45 kilometer, or so, radius. Doing so in an anti-matter explosion that leaves nothing but a giant void.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Now the only people that venture out of the cities are called porters. Mainly because since they 
                        move around, they’re tasked with carrying packages to different bunkers around the UCA. This is 
                        where our protagonist comes in. <span>Sam Porter Bridges</span>, name of our main hero. A semi-successful 
                        porter, known to all as “The Great Deliverer”. Sam, as well as other characters, is able to 
                        sense the BTs and has a deep connection to the Beaches. <span>Beaches</span> are the representation of Limbo 
                        and is where souls of the dead are sent. It is also where the BTs originate from. Sam, being a 
                        porter, is tasked to deliver medicine to the current president of the UCA which turns out to be 
                        his own mother. After talking with her and some other incidents, he is then tasked with 
                        connecting all of the bunkers and bunker-cities through out the UCA, to a chiral-network. 
                        A network system that can withstand the timefall and BT activity. All of this to save his sister 
                        who is supposedly being held hostage by a terrorist group that wants to let the world be 
                        destroyed. As Sam and all the members of the UCA, work together to save his sister, we uncover 
                        the truth about everything. BTs, BBs, the beaches, Sam himself, everything.</p>

                <div class="practices-text">
                    <p>First off, is my cargo. This is very important for survival. I will tell you what my cargo was by the end of the story.</p>
                    <img class="right-pic" src="assets/death-stranding/DEATH_STRANDING_20200517134728.jpg" width="483" height="240" alt="right-pic">
                    <ul class="practices">
                        <li>2 non-lethal assault (lv.3)</li>
                        <li>1 sticky gun (or grenade launcher)</li>
                        <li>1 Bola gun (lv.2)</li>
                        <li>1 ladder</li>
                        <li>2 Climbing anchors (lv.2)</li>
                        <li>2 PCC (lv.2)</li>
                        <li>3 Bridges boots (lv.3)</li>
                        <li>3 blood bags</li>
                        <li>1 exo-skeleton (lv.3 of any type is useful)</li>
                        <li>1 power gloves</li>
                        <li>2 Hematic Grenades (lv.2)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The cargo I had by the end of the game was like this, mostly because I took a lot of time getting materials for the roads before engaging in the actual story.
                        Next is the way I played the game. It'll be like a list of guidelines but thats to make it easier to read.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="practices">
                        <li>Always have a vehicle the moment you get the blueprints for it.</li>
                        <li>Have an extra battery on your backpack the moment you get it</li>
                        <li>Have the backpack cover since the moment you get it</li>
                        <li>Take your time and build the roads, they’re extremely useful to get from one side of the map to the other.</li>
                        <li>Create bridges whenever you find a useful spot.</li>
                        <li>Wherever there is no roads, build: bridges, generators and/or safehouses to make your gameplay easier.</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to the map when you’re in the mountains, it will let you know where you can go through with a vehicle most times.</li>
                        <li>Don’t be scared of BTs, they’re dumb and can only hear you if you run or walk normally. Just crouch and move as fast as possible.</li>
                        <li>Always be ready to blow BTs with the Hematic Grenades.</li>
                        <li>If there is music on your screen, it means you’re safe so enjoy the view.</li>
                        <li>Whatever and wherever you build, make sure it will be useful to everyone, not just yourself. No one needs more obstacles in the road.</li>
                        <li>Don’t be scared of the MULEs, use the bola gun and tie them up one after the other and then knock them out.</li>
                        <li>Keep Cryptobiotes on yourself, they’re perfect for maintaining blood levels faster than what a blood bag does.</li>
                        <li>If you’re in a BT infested area, drive by the edge of it. There will be a slimmer chance of finding a BT there.</li>
                        <li>Let the game auto-arrange the cargo, that way its easier to manage.</li>
                        <li>Spam that scanner and know your surroundings.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I will have to mention that I had 70 hours of game time accumulated when I finished the story. 
                        This is because I took my sweet time constructing the main roads connecting the bunker-cities in the game. 
                        I did this because it made it much more easier to go from one place to the other. The roads in the game are a very valuable asset. 
                        They have a weak generator included in them which impede the battery of your vehicle from 
                        draining. Roads are also made to go through spots where the BTs do not appear or go through. 
                        Even when it is raining and infested with BTs, they do not reach the roads so you're defnitely safe inside the roads.
                        Not to boast or anything, but in the server where I am connected to, I built near 70% of the roads. The rest was already constructed by another player.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><span>STILL!!!!</span> The best way to play this game is to take it easy and enjoy it. There's no need to rush nor is there anything to be scared of. 
                        I played this game blasting my way through monsters and tying up MULEs and driving through all the terrains making my own roads to get through places 
                        the safest and laziest ways possible. Also, I recommend that you listen to the music from the game. If you like relaxing music like I do, it is perfect for you.
                    </p>
