            <h3 class="ap-content-head">Why did I create this page?</h3>
            <p>I created this website: Gamer's Ripple. The reason being, that I had to create a website for my Web design course. 
                I decided on this theme because I have always been able to play videogames throughout my entire life and it is something 
                which I have most knowledge on. After pondering on what to do, I came to that conclusion.</p>
            <h3 class="ap-content-head-2">Why the first post?</h3>
            <p>I decided on what I chose as my first post, because it is about a game that came out recently and I wanted people to 
                know about it and about how I played and completed the game. It took quite a while but I'd say "it was worth it". 
                The game is titled "Death Stranding", made by Kojima Studios' Hideo Kojima. A game developer that has worked on so many titles 
                I've played throughout my life so I can say for certain that I was going to get this game at any point. </p>
